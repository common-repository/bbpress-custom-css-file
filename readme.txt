== Description ==

#### This plugin has been deprecated

**As of bbPress 2.2 this plugin is NOT needed.** bbPress will __auto-detect__ the CSS file if it exists in the right location.

#### Directions to use custom CSS file without a plugin

Copy:
`wp-content/plugins/bbpress/templates/default/css/bbpress.css`
to:
`wp-content/themes/[YOUR-THEME]/css/bbpress.css`

And that's all it takes.

== Installation ==

* This plugin has been deprecated and shouldn't be used.
* Instead, copy `wp-content/plugins/bbpress/templates/default/css/bbpress.css` to `wp-content/themes/[YOUR-THEME]/css/bbpress.css`.
* bbPress will use this new CSS file instead of it's own, so it can be easily customized.
* Enjoy bbPress!
